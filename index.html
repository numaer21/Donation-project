                <h2>Education for a child</h2>
                <p>Education is the foremost important aspect for everyone. But
                    for a child education is necessary as they absobs the basics of everything quickly. The poor
                    people dosen't seem to understand the concept and forces their children to work and earn the
                    bread of the family at an early age for which they remain uneducated and cannot grow in life.
                    And that is why we are
                    trying to get people know about education and the power of it and help the children to go to
                    school for which we are raising the fund necessary for it.</p>
